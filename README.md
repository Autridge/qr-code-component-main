## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned basic positioning in CSS.

### Continued development

Hopefully, I can focus on responsiven designs and max-width of a container. That way I can't always use <br> in the markup.

### Useful resources

https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples - This helped me with the box-shadow of the card.
Hopefully, somedays, I can create my custom shadows without the help of online generators, or maybe a little.
